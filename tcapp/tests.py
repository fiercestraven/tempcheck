# fv - next steps: give modules an "active/inactive" attribute. Only display modules that are active. Test this. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial05/
# fv - after that, add a similar get_queryset method to ResultsView and create a new test class for that view.
# fv - then, Questions can be published on the site that have no Choices. So, our views could check for this, and exclude such Questions. Our tests would create a Question without Choices and then test that itâ€™s not published, as well as create a similar Question with Choices, and test that it is published.
# fv - future tests might include making sure only pings in the relevant time frame are included. Make sure no pages are returning 404 that shouldn't be.
# fv - note - have a separate TestClass for each model or view, and a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
